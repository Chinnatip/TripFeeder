      "If you don‚Äôt like planes and prefer to rather stretch your body, while watching some movies on your way to the other part of the country, eating snacks that you‚Äôve prepared for yourself in advance, then a train is what you have to choose in Thailand!",
      "Thailand trains are amazing! Thai railways are constantly improving, for example, in 2017, the Bangkok - Chiang Mai line was fixed and new rails, trackbeds, and ties are there now!",
      "Moreover, Thai people are seriously concerned about the environment recently which made them rethink the transport system as well. That‚Äôs why the new trains in Thailand replaced standalone diesel-electric engine trains with powered cars. Moreover, the new trains are fully adapted for people with disabilities. You will feel more safe with the security cameras which every car is equipped with."

Every year you see more and more modern luxury buses with Wifi, AC, sleeping chairs and even little tablets inserted in the seat in front of you. The only thing you have to do is to choose the company you trust and feel safe with!",

      "The greatest thing about booking your bus online is that you don‚Äôt have to carry the paper ticket. It is accessible anytime on your smartphone through email, even if you are not connected to the Internet."

      "Ferry in Thailand is the only way to get to your island destination unless you use a helicopter or swim across. That‚Äôs why there is a huge variety of water vehicles to choose from in Thailand: ferry, speed boat, high-speed catamaran, long-tailed boats, express boats. It all depends on your preferences and timing because some of them are much faster than the others, more comfortable and have different levels of service.",
      "The story with Titanic is far away and nowadays water transport is considered the safest in the world according to BBC. Thai water transport companies are constantly improving their services including more and more modern features like an open top deck with comfortable seats, fully equipped snack bar, conditioned salons, professional crew that performs a high level of services and new and fast vehicles!",
      "If you are planning the beach vacation in Thailand or if you want to do the island hopping - ferry is something you will come across very often! Any ferry you‚Äôll choose on Kohlife will be the right choice since we inspect each company before partnership!"
